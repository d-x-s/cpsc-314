Implemented features and keybindings:


Requirements:
(a) Demonstrate an understanding of the fundamentals of the code to your TA

    (i) Ensure that the scene loads and plays the basic animation 

    (ii) Understand how objects are loaded from OBJ files (see initFileObjects, onResourcesLoaded)
         Add an extra teaopot to your scene at a desired location and in a desired orientation 
        - initFileObjects loads directly from object files
        - use LoadingManager to make async call to onResourcesLoaded when models are ready
        - clone copies of the model in onResourcesLoaded and place them in the scene

    (iii) Understand how the myboxMotion and handMotion keyframes influence the motion (see initMotions())
        - "keyframes" refer to the set of positions/rotations of an object at a specific point in time
           > they are used to define the animation sequence by specifying the starting/ending states of the object  
           > the keyframes in-between dictate the object's intermediate states over time
           > nimation is then generated by interpolating between these keyframes to produce smooth motion
           > keyframes allow animators control the motion of objects in a 3D scene!
        - "avars" are animation varialbes whcih are used to control the motion of an object
           > typically used in conjunction with keyframes
           > thought of as parameters that influence the motion of an object over time
           > I.E. an avar might control the position of an object alonga specific axis, its rotation around an axis, etc.
           > can be set to specific values at different keyframes in the animation, allowing for fine control
           > can also have interpolated values voer tiem to produce smooth and believalbe animations
        - make myBox travel higher by modifying 'pose C' keyframe
        - animate the orientation of link1 by providing it with an alternative avar (5 in this case)
        - increase the amount of the right finger bend by adjusting theta2 and theta3

    (iv) Understand how handSetMatrices() makes use of avars to build the relevant transformation handSetMatrices
        - see above 
          > start by declaring a motion "var handMotion = new Motion(handSetMatrices);"
          > it is associated with the handSetMatrices function
          > handSetMatrices does all the necessary matrix computations
          > it uses the avars declared in the KeyFrame in its matrix calculations
        - make the palm wider in the Z-dimension in handSetMatrices by adjusting the z-parameter of the MakeScale matrix
        - make the palm longer in the X-dimension in handSetMatrices by adjustign the x-parameter of MakeScale matrix
          > in addition, move fingers to the edge of the new palm by adjusting the translation relative to the parent frame

(b) Developed a static cat model

(c) Cat jumps

(d) Simple kicking motion

(e) Creative component
    - added fog to scene
    - add joints (capsules) for better anatomical representation
    - z-axis animated jump to realistic jump that uses hind legs, tail motion, neck motion, leg wind-up
    - add grass texture for floor
    - add kicking motion for cat
    - add bouncing beach ball with texture that also rolls
    - add meow sound effect
