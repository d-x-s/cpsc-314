CREATIVE COMPONENT

(1) GENERAL COMMENTS
It was interesting reading about the three.JS documentation and seeing all the possibilities.
I'd like to try making something animated next time, such as a spinning object.

(2) A FEW THINGS I LEARNED WHILE WORKING ON THE CREATIVE COMPONENT
Objects are composed of many vertices connected by a mesh.
There can be so many vertices that an object appears smooth.
GLSL offers some convenient functions such as dot().
